## Data Structures 💾

### Red-Black Tree 🌳
- **Understanding**: A self-balancing binary search tree that uses red and black color properties to maintain balance.
- **Challenges**:  
  - Managing color properties during insertions and deletions.  
  - Performing rotations and recoloring accurately.
- **Next Steps**:  
  - Watch more step-by-step animations on Visualgo.  
  - Implement small examples to reinforce the concepts.

### B-Tree 🗃️
- **Understanding**: A multi-way search tree commonly used in databases.
- **Challenges**:  
  - Handling node splitting and merging operations.  
  - Maintaining properties across multiple levels.
- **Next Steps**:  
  - Study real-world use cases (like database indexing).  
  - Practice with simplified examples.

### Segment Tree 📊
- **Understanding**: Efficiently answers range queries (e.g., sums, minimums) on an array.
- **Challenges**:  
  - Constructing the tree and managing lazy propagation.
- **Next Steps**:  
  - Implement the tree from scratch while following animated guides.

### Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree) 📈
- **Understanding**: Efficient structure for cumulative frequency and range sum queries.
- **Challenges**:  
  - Mastering index manipulation (e.g., using `index & -index`).
- **Next Steps**:  
  - Engage in hands-on exercises to master the update/query steps.

### Graph Algorithms 🕸️
- **Understanding**: Includes BFS, DFS, MST (Kruskal, Prim), and shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford).
- **Challenges**:  
  - Managing edge cases in complex graphs.  
  - Deciding between adjacency list vs. matrix representations.
- **Next Steps**:  
  - Tackle diverse graph problems while following dynamic visualizations.

## Sorting Algorithms 🔀

### Quick Sort ⚡
- **Understanding**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that uses a pivot for partitioning the array.
- **Challenges**:  
  - Selecting the right pivot and ensuring correct in-place partitioning.
- **Next Steps**:  
  - Experiment with different pivot strategies and review animation sequences.

### Heap Sort 🎢
- **Understanding**: Builds a max-heap and repeatedly extracts the maximum to sort the array.
- **Challenges**:  
  - Maintaining the heap property during extractions.
- **Next Steps**:  
  - Code the algorithm and visualize the heapification process.

### Radix Sort 🔢
- **Understanding**: A non-comparative sort that processes digits (or characters) from least to most significant.
- **Challenges**:  
  - Ensuring stability during each digit pass and managing different numeral bases.
- **Next Steps**:  
  - Walk through manual examples with animated step-by-step visuals.

### Merge Sort 🔀 *(Bonus)*
- **Understanding**: Recursively divides and merges the array.
- **Challenges**:  
  - Handling in-place merging versus using auxiliary arrays.
- **Next Steps**:  
  - Revisit the algorithm with detailed animation guides.
